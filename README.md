Summary  
Overall, Tata Motors has shown a remarkable turnaround in FY24 after facing challenges in the preceding years.

Summary
Tata Motors has maintained a stable sales base over the years, but its profitability has been volatile, influenced by high raw material costs and fluctuating economic conditions.
